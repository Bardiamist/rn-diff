Hello :)

Issue saying "RN X.X.X version is out" are generally useless
because I've subscribed to the Github release feed
https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases.atom, it is
added in my favorite Feedly feeds and brought to my attention by the Feedly
notifier Chrome extension. So I really can't miss a new release ;)

However I recognize I sometimes need to get my ass kicked, so please, post such
an issue if the release is out for more than 2 or 3 days!

Of course, other kinds of issues, any thoughts, discussions, are warmly welcome!
